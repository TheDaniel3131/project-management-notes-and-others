# Chapter 6
# Planning Part 2 - Schedule & Cost

## Project Schedule Management
- Involves the processes required to ensure the project completion time.
- Main Planning Tasks:
   - Planning Schedule Management
   - Defining Activities
   - Sequence Activities
   - Estimating Activity Duration
   - Developing Project Schedule
- Main Documents:
  - Schedule Management Plan
  - Activity List & Attributes
  - Milestone List
  - Network Diagram
  - Activity Duration Estimates
  - Schedule Baseline
  - Project Schedule
  - Project Calendars

## Schedule Management Plan
- Schedule, methodology, tools to create schedule model.
- Release and iteration length, or time-boxed periods.
- Level of accuracy required for activity duration estimates.
- Units of measure, such as staff hours, days or weeks.
- Organizational procedure links
- Project schedule model amintenance.
- Control thresholds for monitoring schedule performance, such as a percentange deviation from the baseline plan.
- Rules of performance measurement, especially if earned value management is used.
- Formats and frequency for schedule reports.

## Defining Acitvities
- Activity: Distinct, schedule portion of work performed during the course of a project.
- Goal of defining activities: Ensure project team members have complete understanding from the works they assign to in the project scope so they can start scheduling their works.

## Creating Activity List and Attributes
- Activity list: Tabulation of activities to be included in a project schedule.
- Include activity name, activity identifier or number, a brief activity description.
- Activity Attributes provide schedule-related information about each activity, such as predecssors, successors, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource reuirement, constraints,, imposed dates, and assumptions related to the activity.
- In agreement with WBS and WBS dictionary -> reviewed by project stakeholders.

#### Example: WBS 100% Rule

## Creating a Milestone List
- A milestone is a significant point or event in a project.
- Often takes serveral activities and a lot of work to complete a milestone, but the milestone itself is like a marker to help identify necessary activities.
- No cost or duration for a milestone.
- Project sponsors and senior managers often focurs on major milestones when reviewing projects.
- Sample milestones for many projects:
   - Sign-off of key documents
   - Completion of specific products
   - Completion of important process-related work such as awarding a contract to a supplier

## Sequencing Activities
- Involves:
   - Review activity list and attributes.
   - Project Scope Statement
   - Milestone list to determine the relationships or dependecies between activities
 
- Dependancy or relationship relates to the sequence of project activities or tasks.
- Has signficiant impact on developing and managing a project schedule.

## Reasons for creating dependencies
- Mandatory dependcies - Inherit the nature of the work being performed on project.
- Discretionary dependecies are defined by the project team.
- External depdencies involves relationship between project and non-project activities.
- Internal dependecies are within the project team's control, such as testing machine that must be first assembled, where all the work is done inside the team.
