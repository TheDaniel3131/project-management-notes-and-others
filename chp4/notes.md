### Mapping the Process Groups to the Knowledge Areas
You can map the five process group into the ten project management knowledge areas

### Developing a Project Management Methodology
1. The PMBOK® Guide is a standard that describes best practices for what should be done to manage a project.
2. A methodology describes how things should be done, and different organizations often have different ways of doing things.
3. Successful organizations develop and follow a customized, formal project management process.

### Other Methodologies
1. PRojects IN Controlled Environments (PRINCE2): Originally developed for IT projects, PRINCE2 was released in 1996 by the U.K. Office of Government Commerce – now used in over 50 countries.
2. Rational Unified Process (RUP) framework:  iterative software development process that focuses on team productivity and delivers software best practices to all team members.
3. Six Sigma: Used to improve quality and processes. Six Sigma’s target for perfection is the achievement of no more than 3.4 defects, errors, or mistakes per million opportunities.

### Agile (Ad Hoc)
1. Many software development projects use agile methods, meaning they use an iterative workflow and incremental delivery of software in short iterations.
2. Popular agile approaches include Scrum, extreme programming, feature driven development, and lean software development. 
3. In 2011, PMI introduced a new certification called Agile Certified Practitioner (ACP) to address the growing interest in agile project management. 

*Note that agile can also be applied to project planning, as described in Chapter 2, as well as many other areas, including manufacturing and even education.*

### Scrum
1. Scrum is the leading agile development method for completing projects with a complex, innovative scope of work
2. The term was coined in 1986 in a Harvard Business Review study that compared high-performing, cross-functional teams to the scrum formation used by rugby teams

### Project Management Office (PMO)
1. A project management office (PMO) is an organizational entity created to assist project managers in achieving project goals.
2. A PMO can help development standards and methodologies, provide career paths for project managers, and assist project managers with training and certification.

### Pre-initiating Processes

### Business Case for a Project
- A business case is a document that provides financial justification for investing in a project.
- Typical contents:
 -  Introduction/Background
 -  Business Objective
 -  Current Situation and Problem/Opportunity Statement
 -  Critical Assumptions and Constraints
 -  Analysis of Options and Recommendations
 -  Preliminary Project Requirements
 -  Budget Estimate and Financial Analysis
 -  Schedule Estimate
 -  Potential Risks
 -  Exhibits

### Initiating Processes
1. Identifying project stakeholders
2. Creating the project charter
3. Creating the assumption log
4. Holding a kick-off meeting

### Identifying Stakeholders

### Stakeholder Register and Stakeholder Analysis

### Categorizing Engagement Levels of Stakeholders
1. Unaware: Unaware of the project and its potential impacts on them.
2. Resistant: Aware of the project yet resistant to change.
3. Neutral: Aware of the project yet neither supportive nor resistant.
4. Supportive: Aware of the project and supportive of change.
5. Leading: Aware of the project and its potential impacts and actively engaged in helping it succeed.

### Creating a Project Charter and Assumption Log
1. A project charter is a document that formally recognizes the existence of a project and provides a summary of the proje.ct’s objectives and management.
2. It authorizes the project manager to use organizational resources to complete the project.
3. Ideally, the project manager will play a major role in developing the project charter.
4. Instead of project charters, some organizations initiate projects using a simple letter of agreement or formal contracts.
5. A crucial part of the project charter is the sign-off section.

### Contents of a Project Charter
1. The project’s title and date of authorization.
2. The project manager’s name and contact information.
3. A summary schedule or timeline, including the planned start and finish dates; if a summary milestone schedule is available, it should also be included or referenced.
4. A summary of the project’s estimated cost and budget allocation.
5. A brief description of the project objectives, including the business need or other justification for authorizing the project.
6. Project success criteria or approval requirements, including project approval requirements and who signs off on the project.
7. A summary of the planned approach for managing the project, which should describe stakeholder needs and expectations, overall project risk, important assumptions and constraints, and should refer to related documents, such as a communications management plan, as available.
8. A roles and responsibilities matrix.
9. A sign-off section for signatures of key project stakeholders.
10. A comments section in which stakeholders can provide important comments related to the project.

##### Figure 3-15. Sample Project Charter:

1. Approach section (partial)
 - Terminate all internal training courses except the Six Sigma training once new courses are developed.
 - Communicate to all employees the plans to improve internal training and let them know that tuition reimbursement will continue as is.
2. Roles and Responsibilities
3. Comments (partial)
 ``` “I want to review all of the information related to providing the supplier management training. We need to make something available quickly.” Tim```

### Contents of An Assumptions Log
1. An assumption log is a document used to record and track assumptions and constraints throughout the project life cycle. 
2. It aids in communicating information to key stakeholders and avoids potential confusion.
3. Most projects include several assumptions that affect the scope, time, cost, risk, and other knowledge areas. 
4. It is important to document and validate these assumptions. 

##### Figure 3-16. Sample Assumptions Log:
![image](https://github.com/TheDaniel3131/project-management-notes-and-others/assets/71692327/a8e47212-7d06-4941-bfc3-4d3840cf9ca0)

### Holding a Project Kick-off Meeting
1. Experienced project managers know that it is crucial to get projects off to a great start.
2. A kick-off meeting is a meeting held at the beginning of a project so that stakeholders can meet each other, review the goals of the project, and discuss future plans. Note that the PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition, suggests that the kick-off meeting be held during the end of the planning or start of the executing process group. In the author’s experience, it is best hold it earlier. 
3. The project champion should speak first and introduce the project sponsor and project manager
4. There is often a fair amount of work is done to prepare for the meeting.
5. If it cannot be held face-to-face, try to include audio and/or video to engage and understand participants.
