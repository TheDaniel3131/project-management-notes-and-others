### Mapping the Process Groups to the Knowledge Areas
You can map the five process group into the ten project management knowledge areas

### Developing a Project Management Methodology
1. The PMBOK® Guide is a standard that describes best practices for what should be done to manage a project.
2. A methodology describes how things should be done, and different organizations often have different ways of doing things.
3. Successful organizations develop and follow a customized, formal project management process.

### Other Methodologies
1. PRojects IN Controlled Environments (PRINCE2): Originally developed for IT projects, PRINCE2 was released in 1996 by the U.K. Office of Government Commerce – now used in over 50 countries.
2. Rational Unified Process (RUP) framework:  iterative software development process that focuses on team productivity and delivers software best practices to all team members.
3. Six Sigma: Used to improve quality and processes. Six Sigma’s target for perfection is the achievement of no more than 3.4 defects, errors, or mistakes per million opportunities.

### Agile (Ad Hoc)
1. Many software development projects use agile methods, meaning they use an iterative workflow and incremental delivery of software in short iterations.
2. Popular agile approaches include Scrum, extreme programming, feature driven development, and lean software development. 
3. In 2011, PMI introduced a new certification called Agile Certified Practitioner (ACP) to address the growing interest in agile project management. 

*Note that agile can also be applied to project planning, as described in Chapter 2, as well as many other areas, including manufacturing and even education.*

### Scrum
1. Scrum is the leading agile development method for completing projects with a complex, innovative scope of work
2. The term was coined in 1986 in a Harvard Business Review study that compared high-performing, cross-functional teams to the scrum formation used by rugby teams

### Project Management Office (PMO)
1. A project management office (PMO) is an organizational entity created to assist project managers in achieving project goals.
2. A PMO can help development standards and methodologies, provide career paths for project managers, and assist project managers with training and certification.
