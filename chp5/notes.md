# Lesson 5

## Project Planning
- Planning is most difficult, and unappreciate in project management.
- Good planning = good execution. Most people do not want to take some time to plan.
- The purpose of project planning must be realistic, useful, and also guided execution.

## Project Integration Management (Knowledge area)
- Involves coordinating all the project management knowledge areas throughout a project's life span.
- Main planning output is project management plan.

## Project Management Plans
- A documemnt use to integrate and coordinate all project planning documemnts to guide a project's execution, monitoring, control, and closure.
- Faciliates communication among stakeholders and provide baseline for progress management and project control. A baseline is starting point or measurement 

## Attributes of Project Management Plans
- Dynamic, Flexible, and Receptive to change when the environment or project changes.

## Common Elements in Project Management Plans
- Introduction / Overview of the project
- Project Organization
- Management and technical process (including project lifecycle description and development approach as applicable)
- Scope (Work to be performed)
- Schedule Information
- Budget Information
- References

## Project Scope Management (Scope = Boundary of the project)
- Involves defining and controlling what work is or not is not included in a project.
- Includes planning scope management, collecting requirements, defining scope, and create the WBS.
- Main documents are required documents, a requirements management plan, a requirements traceability matrix, a scope baseline to compose an approved scope statement called Work Breakdown Structure.

## Planning Scope Management
- To determine how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.
  - Validation = Formmal acceptance of deliverables by customers and stakeholders.
  - Verification = Deliverable compiles with a regulation, requirement, specifcation or imposed condition.
- Usually the project teams have some meetings with experts or stakeholders to develop the scope management plan.

## Processes in Scope Management Plan
- Prepare a well-detailed project scope statement.
- Creating, maintaining, and approving the WBS.
- Obtaining acceptance based on the project deliverables.
- Controlling how change requests will be processed.

## Collecting Requirements
- A requirement management plan describes how project requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed.

### Output of Collecting Requirements
- Requirements documents, which can range from a single-page checklist to a room full of notebooks with text, diagrams, images, etc.
- A requirements traceability matrix (RTM), which is a table that lists requirements, various attributes of each requirement, and the status of the requirements to ensure that all of them are addressed

## Defining Scope
- Crucial to Project Success.
- Helps to improve accuracy or quality of work, time, cost, resources estimmmates.
- Defines a baseline for performance measurement and project control.
- Aids in communicating tasks and responsibilities.
- Describes product characteristics and requirement, user acceptance criteria, and deliverables.
- Work that is not included should not be done if it is not in scope which are called project exclusions.

## Creating Work Breakdown Structure
- A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines the total scope of the project.
- The WBS is a document that breaks all the work required for the project into discrete deliverables, and groups them into a logical hierarchy Often shown in two different forms: Graphical or chart form Tabular or list form.
