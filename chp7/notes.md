# Chapter 7

## Project Quality Management
- Ensures the project will satisfy or implied needs which it was undertaken.
- Key outputs produced as part of project quality management include a quality management plan, quality metrics, and updates to the project management plan and project documents.

## Quality
- the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements.

## Quality Planning & Quality Management Plan
- Quality planning includes identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project and how best to satisfy those standards
- It also involves designing quality into the products of the project as well as the processes involved in managing the project.
- Like other plans, the size and complexity of quality management plans varies to meet project needs.

## Quality Standards
- Reliability
- Maturity: Capability of the software to avoid failures due to defects.
- Fault Tolerance: Capability of the software to maintain a specified level of performance in the presence of software faults. (Ex: Local Disk/Hard Drive Spaces)

## Quality Metrics
- A standard of measurement.
- Allows organizations to measure their peformance in certain areas and to compare them over time or with other organizations.
- Examples of common metrics used by organizations include failure rates of products produced, availability of goods and services, and customer satisfaction ratings.

## Project Resource Management
- Concerned with making effective use of the people involved with a project as well as physical resources (materials, facilities, equipment, and infrastructure)

## Team Management Plan
- Project Organization Plan
- Responsibility assignment matrix
- Resource histogram
- Staffing management plan

### Project Organizational Chart
- A graphical representation of how authority and responsibility is distributed within the project.
- The size and complexity of the project determines how simple or complex the organizational chart is.

## Responsibility Assignment Matrices (RAM)
- A matrix that maps the work of the project as described in the work breakdown structure (WBS) to the people responsible for performing the work.
- For smaller projects, it is best to assign WBS activities to individuals; for larger projects, it is more effective to assign the work to organizational units or teams
- RACI charts are a type of RAM that show Responsibility (who does the task), Accountability (who signs off on the task or has authority for it), Consultation (who has information necessary to complete the task), and Informed (who needs to be notified of task status/results) roles for project stakeholders

## Resource Histograms
- A resource histogram is a column chart that shows the number of resources required for or assigned to a project over time.
- In planning project staffing needs, senior managers often create a resource histogram in which columns represent the number of people needed in each skill category. By stacking the columns, you can see the total number of people needed each month.
- After resources are assigned to a project, you can view a resource histogram for each person to see how his/her time has been allocated.

###### Sample Resource Histogram

## Staffing Management Plan
- Describes when and how people will be added to and removed from a project.
- Describes the types of people needed to work on the project, the numbers needed for each type of person each month, and how these resources will be acquired, trained, rewarded, and reassigned after the project

## Team Charter
- Many companies believe in using team charters to help promote teamwork and clarify team communications. 
- After core project team members have been selected, they meet to prepare a team charter to guide how the team will function. 
- It is crucial to emphasize the importance of the project team throughout the projectâ€™s life cycle, and the team charter should be updated as needed.

## Estimamting Activity Resources
- Estimating activity resources involves estimating the type, quantity and characteristics of team resources and physical resources (i.e., materials, equipment, and supplies) required to complete the project.
- This process is closely related to estimating activity durations and costs.
- It is important that the people who help determine what resources are necessary include people who have experience and expertise in similar projects and with the organization performing the project. 
- Resource estimates should be updated as needed during the project.]
