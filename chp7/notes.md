# Chapter 7

## Project Quality Management
- Ensures the project will satisfy or implied needs which it was undertaken.
- Key outputs produced as part of project quality management include a quality management plan, quality metrics, and updates to the project management plan and project documents.

## Quality
- the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements.

## Quality Planning & Quality Management Plan
- Quality planning includes identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project and how best to satisfy those standards
- It also involves designing quality into the products of the project as well as the processes involved in managing the project.
- Like other plans, the size and complexity of quality management plans varies to meet project needs.

## Quality Standards
- Reliability
- Maturity: Capability of the software to avoid failures due to defects.
- Fault Tolerance: Capability of the software to maintain a specified level of performance in the presence of software faults. (Ex: Local Disk/Hard Drive Spaces)

## Quality Metrics
- A standard of measurement.
- Allows organizations to measure their peformance in certain areas and to compare them over time or with other organizations.
- Examples of common metrics used by organizations include failure rates of products produced, availability of goods and services, and customer satisfaction ratings.

## Project Resource Management
- Concerned with making effective use of the people involved with a project as well as physical resources (materials, facilities, equipment, and infrastructure)

## Team Management Plan
- Project Organization Plan
- Responsibility assignment matrix
- Resource histogram
- Staffing management plan

### Project Organizational Chart
- A graphical representation of how authority and responsibility is distributed within the project.
- The size and complexity of the project determines how simple or complex the organizational chart is.

## Responsibility Assignment Matrices (RAM)
- A matrix that maps the work of the project as described in the work breakdown structure (WBS) to the people responsible for performing the work.
- For smaller projects, it is best to assign WBS activities to individuals; for larger projects, it is more effective to assign the work to organizational units or teams
- RACI charts are a type of RAM that show Responsibility (who does the task), Accountability (who signs off on the task or has authority for it), Consultation (who has information necessary to complete the task), and Informed (who needs to be notified of task status/results) roles for project stakeholders
