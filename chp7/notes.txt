**This topic focuses on the project risk, stakeholder and procurement knowledge areas and planning process group**

Stakeholder Engagement

Qualitative risk analysis can be done by using:

Other risk plans

1. Contingency plans - for predefined actions if the identified risk event occurs
2. Fallback plans - Risks that have a high impact on meeting the objectives 
3. Contingency reserves/contingency allowances - Funds from project sponsor that can be used to mitigate the cost or schedule overruns if known risks occur.
4. Management reserves - Funds for unknown risks used for management control purposes 

Risk register (assignment related)
